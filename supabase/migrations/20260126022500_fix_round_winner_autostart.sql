-- Migration: Fix on_round_winner_set to use create_round_for_cycle
-- 
-- BUG: The trigger was creating new rounds directly with 'waiting' phase,
-- ignoring the chat's start_mode setting.
--
-- FIX: Use create_round_for_cycle() helper which properly checks auto-start
-- conditions and creates rounds in 'proposing' phase when appropriate.
